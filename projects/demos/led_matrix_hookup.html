        <h1>Hooking up LED Matrices</h1>
        <h2>Need:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>At least 1 LED matrix module
                <li>6 male to female jumper wires
                <li>1 male to male jumper wire
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>If you have more than 1 LED matrix, connect the LED matrices together using the 6 pins from one matrix into the socket of another.
                <li>Place the LED matrix modules on the breadboard, using the 4 pins of each matrix as support. <!-- TODO: we have the 4 pins? -->
                <li>Using the 6 male to female jumper wires, connect the 6 pins of the first matrix to the correct ports of the Raspberry Pi.
                    <!-- TODO: add a wiring diagram -->
                <li>Using the male to male jumper wire, connect the 3 left most socket of the last matrix to the 9/MISO port on the Raspberry Pi.
                    <!-- TODO: add a wiring diagram -->
            </ol>
