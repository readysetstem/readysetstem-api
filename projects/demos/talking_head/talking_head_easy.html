        <h1>Talking Head - Easy <br> Hello World</h1>
            <p>In this demo we will be showing how to get the Raspberry Pi to convert
            given text such as "Hello World" into speach and then play it.
            
        <h2>Setup</h2>
            <h3>Need:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 LED matrix
                </ul>
                
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Connect the speaker??
                </ol>
                
        <h2>Programming</h2>
            <ol>
                
                <li>First, create <code>led_matrix.LEDSprite()</code> variables <code>mouth_open</code> and <code>mouth_closed</code>
                to be later used in the upcoming <code>while</code> loop.
                
                <li>Then, we create a <code>speaker.Speech()</code> object variable called <code>my_speech</code> for the
                text we want the hear. This object converts the text into and object that Raspberry Pi can play.
                
                <li>Then, we play the speech by calling <code>my_speech.play()</code>
                
                <li>Now, we create a <code>while</code> loop that will continuously loop until the speech that we just started
                playing has finished playing. This loop will continuously open and close the mouth while the speech is playing
                by displaying the open and closed mouth sprites in succession.
                    <ol>
                        <li>In the <code>while</code> loop we first clear the LED matrix display from the previous sprite that may be displayed.
                        
                        <li>Next, we first draw the open mouth sprite using <code>led_matrix.sprite()</code>
                        
                        <li>Then, we want display the sprite that we have just drawn using <code>led_matrix.show()</code>.
                        
                        <li>Then, to make sure the program waits a little bit to allow us to see the sprite before it moves on, we
                        can use <code>time.sleep(.1)</code> to make the program delay for a fraction of a second.
                        
                        <li>Finally, we want to repeat the last 4 steps to display the sprite of the mouth closed.
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
