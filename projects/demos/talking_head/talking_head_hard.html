        <h1>Talking Head - Hard <br> Soundboard</h1>
            <p>In this demo we will be showing how to create a soundboard for the talking head
            created in <a href="talking_head_medium.html">medium</a>.
            
        <h2>Setup</h2>
            <h3>Need:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 LED matrix
                    <li>8 buttons
                    <li>17 jumper wires
                </ul>
                
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Connect the speaker????
                    <li>Connect led matrix together by ....... TODO: link to already existing instructions?
                    <li>Place each button in a seperate area of the breadboard <!-- TODO: teach how breadboard work? -->
                    <li>Connect one side of each button to one of the following ports: 4, 17, 25, 24, 23, 18, 27, and 22
                        <p>Make sure each button is connected to its own port.
                    <li>Connect the other side of each button to the negative rail.
                    <li>Connect the negative rail to a GND port on the Raspberry Pi.
                </ol>
                
        <h2>Programming</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>First we create a dictionary that will match our buttons to speeches that will be talked when the button is pressed.
                <p>The button is created using a Button object from <code>button.Button()</code> and the speech is created by 
                <code>speaker.Speech()</code>
                
                <li>Then, we need to create <code>led_matrix.LEDSprite()</code> object variables for our sprites of a face
                with its mouth open or mouth close.
                
                <li>Next we create a <code>while</code> loop that will loop infinitly by setting the conditional to <code>True</code>
                
                <li>Next we want to pick out which speech to play based on which button is pressed.
                <p>To do this, we first set our <code>my_speech</code> variable to <code>None</code> and then we go through
                a <code>while</code> loop until the variable has finally been set.
                
                <li>In this while loop, we use a <code>for</code> loop and an <code>if</code> statement to check to go through
                each button and see if it is pressed. If it is, we set the given <code>Speech</code> object of that button
                to the <code>my_speech</code> variable, which will allow the program to exit the <code>while</code> loop.
                
                <li>After we have selected the correct <code>Speech</code> object and set it to <code>my_speech</code>, we then
                start playing the speech by calling <code>my_speech.play()</code>
                
                <li>Now, we create a <code>while</code> loop that will continuously loop until the speech that we just started
                playing has finished playing. This loop will continuously open and close the mouth while the speech is playing
                by displaying the open and closed mouth sprites in succession.
                
                <li>In the <code>while</code> loop we first clear the LED matrix display from the previous sprite that may be displayed.
                
                <li>Next, we first draw the open mouth sprite using <code>led_matrix.sprite()</code>
                
                <li>Then, we want display the sprite that we have just drawn using <code>led_matrix.show()</code>.
                
                <li>Then, to make sure the program waits a little bit to allow us to see the sprite before it moves on, we
                can use <code>time.sleep(.1)</code> to make the program delay for a fraction of a second.
                
                <li>Finally, we want to repeat the last 4 steps to display the sprite of the mouth closed.
