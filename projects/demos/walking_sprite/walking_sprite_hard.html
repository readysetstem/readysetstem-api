<!-- IDEAS:
    - Link to an already existing setup instructions for the LED Matrix?
    - Change terms like "while", "for", "if" into links that the user can click to get information about them?
        - Also link to led_matrix api functions which a simple explaination of how it works?

        <h1>Walking Sprite - Hard <br> Zombie Walker</h1>
            <p>In this demo we will be demonstrating a simple animation of a guy walking like in 
            <a href="walking_sprite_easy.html">Easy</a>
            but now, move the sprite back and forth as the guy is animated.
            
        <h2>Setup</h2>
            <h3>Need:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>At least 1 LED matrix (although more than 1 LED matrix works better)
                </ul>
                
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Connect led matrix together by ....... TODO: link to already existing instructions?
                </ol>
                
        <h2>Programming</h2>  <!-- Explaining the animation in terms of a flipbook -->
            <h3>Setting up the sprites and variables</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>There are 7 sprite files called <i>man1.spr</i> to <i>man7.spr</i>. These files are sprites that
                    show the walking guy and different points in his walk. 
                    <p>The sprite files are like the individual
                    pages of a flip book. We want to define these pages to the program.
                    <p>The first thing we do is tell the program where these sprite files are by using <code>led_matrix.LEDSprite()</code> to make sprite variables. And at the same time, put them into a list called <code>frames</code>. Similar to the process done in
                    Easy. <!-- TODO: better way to explain this? -->
                    <p>We can do this efficiently by using a <code>for</code> loop and taking advantage of the fact that all the
                    sprite are labeled <i>manX.spr</i> where X is a number.  <!-- TODO: say this less mathy? -->
                    <!-- TODO: a way to make footnote style notes to briefly explain python concepts like the following? -->
                    <p><b>Note:</b> <code>range(1,8)</code> will tell the <code>for</code> loop to loop from 1 to 7 (not encluding 8).
                    <code>i</code> is the variable representing the current number the for loop is on.
                    <p><i>For example:</i><br>
                    <code>for i in range(1,4):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(i)</code><br>
                    <p>Would print:<br>
                    <code>1<br>2<br>3<br></code>
                    
                    <li>We want to setup a variable called <code>moving_right</code>. This variable will be a <i>boolean</i> 
                    (2 values <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>). The variable will be used to help the program know if the 
                    sprite is currently walking to the right or to the left. (This is information the program needs to know, to 
                    know how to properly draw the sprite)
                    
                    <li>We then setup a variable called <code>x</code> which will indicate the current horizontal position the 
                    sprite is located. (This is another useful piece of information for the program to know how to draw the sprite.)
                    
                </ol>
            
            <h3>Setting up the looping</h3> <!-- Same instructions as on Easy -->
                <ol>
                    <li>Next we want to set up an infinite loop using a <code>while</code> followed by <code>True</code>.
                    This tells the program that <i>"while True is True, we want to loop through the indented stuff"</i>
                    
                    <li>Next we want to loop through all of the frames in our <code>frames</code> list.
                    <br><code>for current_sprite in frames:</code> will go through each sprite in the <code>frames</code> 
                    list, in order, and run the code below it. The current sprite that the <code>for</code> loop is on 
                    when running the code below it will be the variable <code>current_sprite</code>.
                </ol>
            
            <h3>Displaying sprites on the LED matrix</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Clear the LED Matrix from the previous sprite that was displayed by using <code>led_matrix.erase()</code>
                    
                    <li>In order to figure out how to draw the next sprite, we need to figure out if the sprite is currently 
                    walking left or right. If <code>moving_right == True</code>, we should display the sprite facing the original direction (right). If <code>moving_right == False</code> the sprite is moving left and we should display the sprite facing the 
                    other direction by drawing a sprite that has been flipped_vertically.
                    
                    <p>In the <code>if</code> statement we are drawing the sprite at either the position <code>(0,0)</code>
                    or <code>(0,2)</code>. 
                    <p>This extra parameter in <code>led_matrix.sprite()</code>, are the coordinates where, with respect
                    to the bottom left corner the LED matrix, the sprite should be displayed. 
                    <p><b>For Example:</b><br>
                    <code>led_matrix.sprite(current_sprite, (1,2))</code> would display the sprite 1 pixel to the right and 2 pixels 
                    up from the pixel at the bottom left corner.  <!-- TODO: need to explain this better -->
                    
                    <li>Drawing the sprite does not actually display the sprite on the LED matrix. To actually display
                    the sprite we must then call <code>led_matrix.show()</code>
                    
                    <li>Now we need to either increase our decrease our x variable by 1 depending if the sprite was going left
                    or right. We determine which way it was going with an <code>if moving_right:</code> statement.
                    
                    <li>We then need to determine if we need to change the <code>moving_right</code>. 
                    <p>The variable needs to be changed from <code>True</code> to <code>False</code> if the sprite has hit the
                    right side of the LED matrix display. Which is when <code>x > (led_matrix.width() - sprite.width)</code> is 
                    <code>True</code>.  <!-- TODO: further explain this? -->
                    <p>Otherwise the variable needs to be changed from <code>False</code> to <code>True</code> if the sprite
                    has hit the left side of the LED matrix display. Which is when <code>x == 0</code>
                    
                    <li>Now that the <code>current_sprite</code> has been displayed. The program should wait a little bit before
                    attempting to display the next sprite. If we don't the sprites will change too fast to be able to see the 
                    animation. (Similar to if you go through a flipbook too fast.)
                    By calling <code>time.sleep(.25)</code>, we tell the program to wait .25 or 1/4 of a second before attempting to
                    display the next sprite. 
                    <p><b>Try This:</b>
                        Try changing the delay time in <code>time.sleep(.25)</code> and see how if affects the animation!
                    </p>  
                </ol>
