<!-- IDEAS:
    - Link to an already existing setup instructions for the LED Matrix?
    - Change terms like "while", "for", "if" into links that the user can click to get information about them?
        - Also link to led_matrix api functions which a simple explaination of how it works?

        <h1>Walking Sprite - Medium <br> Jumping Man</h1>
            <p>In this demo we will be demonstrating a simple animation of a guy walking like in 
            <a href="walking_sprite_easy.html">Easy</a>
            but add the ability to press a button to make the guy jump.</p>
            
        <h2>Setup</h2>
            <h3>Need:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>At least 1 LED matrix
                    <li>A button
                    <li>2 jumper wires for the button
                </ul>
                
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Connect led matrix together by ....... TODO: link to already existing instructions?
                    <li>Place the button on the breadboard.
                    <li>Using a jumper wire, connect on side of the button to a <i>GND</i> pin on the Raspberry Pi.
                    <li>Using the other jumper wire, connect the other side of the button to pin 4 on the Raspberry Pi.
                    <!-- TODO: Need pictures -->
                </ol>
                
        <h2>Programming</h2>  <!-- Explaining the animation in terms of a flipbook -->
            <h3>Setting up the button and sprites</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>First, we want to set up the button that is connected to port 4 of the Raspberry Pi.
                    We set up a <code>my_button</code> variable that defines the button attached to port 4, by calling
                    <code>button.Button(4)</code>
                    
                    <li><p>There are 7 sprite files called <i>man1.spr</i> to <i>man7.spr</i>. These files are sprites that
                    show the walking guy and different points in his walk. 
                    <p>The sprite files are like the individual
                    pages of a flip book. We want to define these pages to the program.
                    <p>The first thing we do is tell the program where these sprite files are by using <code>led_matrix.LEDSprite()</code> to make sprite variables. And at the same time, put them into a list called <code>frames</code>. Similar to the process done in
                    Easy. <!-- TODO: better way to explain this? -->
                    <p>We can do this efficiently by using a <code>for</code> loop and taking advantage of the fact that all the
                    sprite are labeled <i>manX.spr</i> where X is a number.  <!-- TODO: say this less mathy? -->
                    <!-- TODO: a way to make footnote style notes to briefly explain python concepts like the following? -->
                    <p><b>Note:</b> <code>range(1,8)</code> will tell the <code>for</code> loop to loop from 1 to 7 (not encluding 8).
                    <code>i</code> is the variable representing the current number the for loop is on.
                    <p><i>For example:</i><br>
                    <code>for i in range(1,4):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(i)</code><br>
                    <p>Would print:<br>
                    <code>1<br>2<br>3<br></code>
                    
                </ol>
            
            <h3>Setting up the looping</h3> <!-- Same instructions as on Easy -->
                <ol>
                    <li>Next we want to set up an infinite loop using a <code>while</code> followed by <code>True</code>.
                    This tells the program that <i>"while True is True, we want to loop through the indented stuff"</i>
                    
                    <li>Next we want to loop through all of the frames in our <code>frames</code> list.
                    <br><code>for current_sprite in frames:</code> will go through each sprite in the <code>frames</code> 
                    list, in order, and run the code below it. The current sprite that the <code>for</code> loop is on 
                    when running the code below it will be the variable <code>current_sprite</code>.
                </ol>
            
            <h3>Displaying sprites on the LED matrix</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Clear the LED Matrix from the previous sprite that was displayed by using <code>led_matrix.erase()</code>
                    
                    <li>In order to figure out how to draw the next sprite, we need to figure out if the user
                    has pressed the button. If the user has pressed the button, we should display the sprite higher up off the ground.
                    <p>To check, we create an <code>if</code> statement that checks if the user has pressed the button. 
                    <code>my_button.is_pressed()</code> will be <code>True</code> if the user has the button pressed down making the 
                    <code>if</code> statement to also be true and call the line under it. 
                    <p>If the statement ends up being <code>False</code> because the user does not have the button pressed down
                    the program will instead run the line under the <code>else:</code>.
                    
                    <p>In the <code>if</code> statement we are drawing the sprite at either the position <code>(0,0)</code>
                    or <code>(0,2)</code>. 
                    <p>This extra parameter in <code>led_matrix.sprite()</code>, are the coordinates where, with respect
                    to the bottom left corner the LED matrix, the sprite should be displayed. 
                    <p><b>For Example:</b><br>
                    <code>led_matrix.sprite(current_sprite, (1,2))</code> would display the sprite 1 pixel to the right and 2 pixels 
                    up from the pixel at the bottom left corner.  <!-- TODO: need to explain this better -->
                    
                    <p><b>Try This:</b>
                        Try changing the coordinates of the sprite when the button is pressed, and see what happens when you
                        press the button!
                    </p> 
                    
                    <li>Drawing the sprite does not actually display the sprite on the LED matrix. To actually display
                    the sprite we must then call <code>led_matrix.show()</code>
                    
                    <li>Now that the <code>current_sprite</code> has been displayed. The program should wait a little bit before
                    attempting to display the next sprite. If we don't the sprites will change too fast to be able to see the 
                    animation. (Similar to if you go through a flipbook too fast.)
                    By calling <code>time.sleep(.25)</code>, we tell the program to wait .25 or 1/4 of a second before attempting to
                    display the next sprite. 
                    <p><b>Try This:</b>
                        Try changing the delay time in <code>time.sleep(.25)</code> and see how if affects the animation!
                    </p>  
                </ol>
