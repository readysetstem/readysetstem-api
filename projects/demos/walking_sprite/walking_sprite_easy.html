<!-- IDEAS:
    - Link to an already existing setup instructions for the LED Matrix?
    - Change terms like "while", "for", "if" into links that the user can click to get information about them?
        - Also link to led_matrix api functions which a simple explaination of how it works?

        <h1>Walking Sprite - Easy</h1>
            <p>In this demo we will be demonstrating a simple animations. This
            will be acheived by quickly showing different sprites in succession
            to simulate the appearance of the sprite walking.</p>
            
        <h2>Setup</h2>
            <h3>Need:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>At least 1 LED matrix
                </ul>
                
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Connect led matrix together by ....... TODO: link to already existing instructions?
                </ol>
                
        <h2>Programming</h2>  <!-- Explaining the animation in terms of a flipbook -->
            <h3>Setting up the sprites</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>There are 7 sprite files called <i>man1.spr</i> to <i>man7.spr</i>. These files are sprites that
                    show the walking guy and different points in his walk. 
                    <p>The sprite files are like the individual
                    pages of a flip book. We want to define these pages to the program.
                    <p>The first thing we do is tell the program where these sprite files are
                    
                    <li>Next we list these sprites in the correct order just like putting the pages of a flipbook in the right order.
                    We call this list <code>frames</code>.
                </ol>
            
            <h3>Setting up the looping</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Next we want to set up an infinite loop using a <code>while</code> followed by <code>True</code>.
                    This tells the program that <i>"while True is True, we want to loop through the indented stuff"</i>
                    
                    <li>Next we want to loop through all of the frames in our <code>frames</code> list.
                    <br><code>for current_sprite in frames:</code> will go through each sprite in the <code>frames</code> list, in order, and run the
                    code below it. The current sprite that the <code>for</code> loop is on when running the code below it will be the
                    variable <code>current_sprite</code>.
                </ol>
            
            <h3>Displaying sprites on the LED matrix</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Clear the LED Matrix from the previous sprite that was displayed by using <code>led_matrix.erase()</code>
                    
                    <li>Now draw our <code>current_sprite</code> onto the LED Matrix by using <code>led_matrix.sprite()</code>.
                    This will tell the LED matrix that we want our <code>current_sprite</code> on the LED matrix.
                    
                    <li>Drawing the sprite does not actually display the sprite on the LED matrix. To actually display
                    the sprite we must call <code>led_matrix.show()</code>
                    
                    <li>Now that the <code>current_sprite</code> has been displayed. The program should wait a little bit before
                    attempting to display the next sprite. If we don't the sprites will change too fast to be able to see the 
                    animation. (Similar to if you go through a flipbook too fast.)
                    By calling <code>time.sleep(.25)</code>, we tell the program to wait .25 or 1/4 of a second before attempting to
                    display the next sprite. 
                    <p><b>Try This:</b>
                        Try changing the delay time in <code>time.sleep(.25)</code> and see how if affects the animation!
                    </p>  
                </ol>
