        <h1>Scrolling Text - Hard <br> Hello World</h1>
            <p>In this demo we will be showing how to display scrolling text.
            
        <h2>Setup</h2>
            <h3>Need:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 LED matrices connected together to make a 1x2 display
                </ul>
                
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Connect led matrix together by ....... TODO: link to already existing instructions?
                </ol>
                
        <h2>Programming</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>First, create a variable that represents the sprite object of the text "Hello World" by using
                <code>led_matrix.LEDSprite()</code>
                <p>By developing this variable we save Raspberry Pi the effort of coverting our given "Hello World"
                text at every iteration of the upcoming <code>for</code> loop, allowing a quicker scrolling of text.
                
                <li>Then create a <code>while</code> loop that will continuously loop infinitly. 
                <p>We can do this by creating the conditional statement to always be <code>True</code>.
                <!-- TODO: Should we be teaching about a while here or just link to something? -->
                
                
                <li>Next, we want to get the width (in pixels) of our <code>my_text_sprite</code> so we know 
                how far to the left should the text be positioned before the text is off the screen.
                <p>We can do this by calling <code>my_text_sprite.width</code>.
                
                <li>Next, we want to set the our original x position to be the width (in pixels) of the LED matrix display using <code>led_matrix.width()</code>.
                This is so we know how far to the right we should originally have the text positioned.

                <li>Then we create a <code>while</code> loop that will keep looping until our text 
                has moved so far to the left that the text is no longer display.
                <p>This will be when <code>x == -text_width</code>. Therefore by setting our conditional
                to <code>while x > -text_width</code>, the loop while continue to be <code>True</code> until
                <code>x == -text_width</code>

                <!-- TODO: too wordy? -->
                
                <li>Inside the <code>while</code> loop we want to clear the LED matrix display from the previous
                display, using <code>led_matrix.erase()</code>
                
                <li>Then, draw the text at our current x value position by setting the position to be <code>(x,0)</code>
                
                <li>Then, we want to show the drawn text by calling <code>led_matrix.show()</code>
                
                <li>Then, delay the program for a fraction of a second so the scrolling text doesn't go too fast.
                
                <li>Finally, we want to decrease our current x value by 1, so that in the next iteration of the
                <code>while</code> loop the text 1 pixel to the left on the display.
