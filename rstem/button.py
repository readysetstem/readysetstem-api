    A `rstem.button.Button` configures a physical button hooked up to a GPIO
    pin.  The physical button should be connected from the GPIO pin to ground.

    `rstem.button.Button` provides a set of functions that make it easy to check
    if and when a button is pressed.  The `rstem.button.Button`
    object reads button presses in the background so that the calling program
    won't lose presses.  Presses and releases are kept in a queue that the
    caller can read at any time.

    More details: The GPIO is configured with an internal pullup so that when
    the button is NOT pressed, the GPIO input is high, and when the button is
    pressed, the input is low (shorted to ground).  Additionaly, The
    `rstem.button.Button` object handles button debouncing.
