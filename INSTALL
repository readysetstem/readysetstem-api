CREATING A NEW RASPBERRYSTEM RELEASE:
    - Update Release version in ./pkg/setup.py
    - make clean
    - Install require install dependences on the RaspberryPi (if you haven't already(
        - On the RaspberryPi, run the following:
            sudo apt-get update
            // TODO: see if all we need is python-all-dev, pips and libi2c-dev
            sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev python-all-dev python3-pip python3-dev python libi2c-dev
            sudo pip install stdeb
            sudo pip3 install stdeb
    - Create a new branch with the name rel/<version> where <version> is the version number as defined in /pkg/setup.py
    - Checkout that branch
    - Triple check this all code is correct and you are ready to upload!
    - Register yourself to PyPi:
        make setup.py
        python setup.py register
        - Create a new account, then let someone like Me add you as a maintainer to the rasperrystem package on PyPi
    - Run the following commands:
        # make release  # TODO
        make upload-cheeseshop
    - Create a Deb package:
        make deb
    - Upload ppa:
        make upload-ppa   # TODO: broken, don't do this yet!

USER INSTALLATION:
    The following instructions are for a user installing the RaspberrySTEM environment.
    NEED: RaspberryPi, SD card, Linux/Mac/Windows

    - Install Raspbian onto the SD card by either writing the image to the SD card or using NOOBS (easier):
        http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/
        NOOBS install: http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/
    - Start up your RaspberryPi and follow the setup procedures on screen.
    - Set up the internet using either Ethernet (not available on model A) or Wifi.
        - To set up Wifi: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-3-network-setup/setting-up-wifi-with-raspbian
    - Using the terminal, we will now install some required programs and then raspberrystem.
        - run the following commands
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get install pip....... TODO
            sudo apt-get install raspberrystemide
            pip install raspberrystem
            pip3 install raspberrystem
