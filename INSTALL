CREATING A NEW RASPBERRYSTEM RELEASE:
    - Update Release version in ./pkg/setup.py
    - Run:
        make clean
    - Install require install dependences on the RaspberryPi you will be building from (if you haven't already)
        - On the RaspberryPi, run the following:
            sudo apt-get update
            // TODO: see if all we need is python-all-dev, pips and libi2c-dev
            sudo apt-get install python3-pip
            (if we want to make a deb file):
                sudo pip3 install stdeb
    - Create a new branch with the name rel/<version> where <version> is the version number as defined in /pkg/setup.py
    - Checkout that branch
    - Triple check this all code is correct and you are ready to upload!
    - Register yourself to PyPi:
        make register  ( if on the pi run: make pi-register)
        - Create a new account, then let someone like Me add you as a maintainer to the rasperrystem package on PyPi
        // TODO: make this a makefile target
    - Run the following commands:
        # make release  # TODO
        make upload-cheeseshop  (if on the pi run: make pi-upload-cheeseshop)
    - Create a Deb package:
        make deb (on the pi run: make pi-deb)
    - Upload ppa:
        make upload-ppa (on the pi run: make pi-upload-ppa) # TODO: broken, don't do this yet!

USER INSTALLATION:
    The following instructions are for a user installing the RaspberrySTEM environment.
    NEED: RaspberryPi, SD card, Linux/Mac/Windows

    - Install Raspbian onto the SD card by either writing the image to the SD card or using NOOBS (easier):
        http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/
        NOOBS install: http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/
    - Start up your RaspberryPi and follow the setup procedures on screen.
        Options to set:
            - (optional) Change to boot directly into desktop
            - Change the timezone
            - Change keyboard to USA:
                Internationalisation Options -> Change Keyboard Layout -> Generic 101-Key PC -> Other -> English (US) -> <OK>
            - Enable the camera
    - Set up the internet using either Ethernet (not available on model A) or Wifi.
        - To set up Wifi: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-3-network-setup/setting-up-wifi-with-raspbian
    - Using the terminal, we will now install some required programs and then raspberrystem.
        - run the following commands
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get install python-pip libi2c-dev
            sudo easy_install raspberrystem
            sudo apt-get install raspberrystemide
